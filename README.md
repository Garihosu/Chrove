A crappy RPG engine for Godot. Nothing else to say.

Used for the game The World is a Machine.

Rather than being used for _other people's_ use, this is mostly
so I can get some help in. I mean, just take a look at my code and you'll see.
If it improves to the point where it's actually usableâ€”then maybe, who knows.
