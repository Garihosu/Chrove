A top-down RPG engine for Godot.

Used for the game The World is a Machine, and possibly others. The battle system
is an Earthbound-like turn-based system.

This engine is not really intended for the works of other people—while it still
could be used for so—and is open-source so that I may get some help and feedback
on the project so that I can make the upcoming game smooth and usable.

Please use Godot v4.0.4. As far as I've tested, the newer versions are kinda broken,
or just didn't run well on my computer.
